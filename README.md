# Password-Generator
This project was less about generating random numbers and more about compiling data that can be accesed and applied. The Instructor and TAs provided much of the code and how to apply it. Trying other methods and logic led to various ways of collecting the data. The references below contain information evident on the project but some serve as a map of the ways I attempted to compile the neccesary data. 

Collaberated with Dan Lucas, Breon Sparrow, Scott Ray, Emily Dobson
